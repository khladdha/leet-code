# 🧩 Leetcode Problem 3304: Find the K-th Character in String Game I

## 📜 Problem Summary

**Starting Point**: Begin with the string `word = "a"`.

**Operation Rule**:  
In each step, for every character in the string:
- Find its **next character** in the English alphabet (wrap around from `'z'` to `'a'`).
- Append all these next characters to the end of the string.

**Goal**: Repeat this operation until the string has at least **`k`** characters.  
Then, return the **k-th character** of the string.

## 🔍 Example Walkthrough (k = 10)

Step-by-step construction:

| Round | Operation | Result |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| Start | Initial   | `a` |
| 1     | `a` → `b` | `ab` |
| 2     | `a`→`b`, `b`→`c` | `abbc` |
| 3     | `a`→`b`, `b`→`c`, `b`→`c`, `c`→`d` | `abbcbccd` |
| 4     | `a`→`b`, `b`→`c`, `b`→`c`, `c`→`d`, `b`→`c`, `c`→`d`, `c`→`d`, `d`→`e` | `abbcbccdbcccddee` |

**Length after round 4** = 16  
✅ `k = 10` → 10th character = **`c`**

## 💡 Optimal Solution Explanation

Instead of simulating the string-building process, there's a smarter approach:

### Key Insight:
- The character at position `k` is determined by how many times `'a'` has shifted.
- Each position in the resulting string is related to the binary representation of `k - 1`.

### 🔢 How it works:
- Convert `k - 1` to binary.
- Count the number of `1`s in the binary representation.
- Add this count to `'a'`.

📌 Example:
- `k = 10` → `k - 1 = 9` → Binary: `1001`
- Number of `1`s = `2`
- `'a' + 2` → `'c'` ✅

### ✅ Time & Space Complexity:
- **O(1)** — constant time and space
- Works efficiently for very large values of `k` (e.g., `10^9`)

## ✅ Solution 1: Optimal (Using Bit Count)
public class R3304 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(kthCharacter(10));  // Output: c
    }

    private static char kthCharacter(int k) {
        return (char) ('a' + Integer.bitCount(k - 1));
    }
}

## 🛠️ Solution 2: Brute Force (Simulating String Construction)
public class R3304 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(kthCharacter(10));  // Output: c
    }

    private static char kthCharacter(int k) {
        StringBuilder builder = new StringBuilder("a");

        while (builder.length() < k) {
            StringBuilder dummy = new StringBuilder();
            for (int i = 0; i < builder.length(); i++) {
                char current = builder.charAt(i);
                char nextChar = (current == 'z') ? 'a' : (char)(current + 1);
                dummy.append(nextChar);
            }
            builder.append(dummy);
        }

        return builder.charAt(k - 1);
    }
}

### 🚀 Conclusion
✅ Use Solution 1 for optimal time/space performance, especially with large k.

🧪 Use Solution 2 to understand the logic or test smaller values.
